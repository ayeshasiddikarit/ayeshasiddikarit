# 2)3 advantages of using a Database over a file system for storing an application's data
Ans:

1)Data Integrity: Databases enforce data integrity constraints, ensuring that it is data and consistent. File systems lack such controls, making it easier for data inconsistencies to occur.

2)Data security: Databases offer robust access control and encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data. File Systems often have limited security features, making data more vulnerable to unauthorized access.

3)Scalability and performance: Databases are designed for efficient data retrieval and can handle large datasets and complex queries as compared to File systems.

4)complexity: Time and space complexity is less in the Database.

# 3) What are the 2 primary ways of storing data in a computer?
Ans:

1)Voltile(temporary memory): such as RAM, is used for temporary storage of data that the computer is actively processing. Data stored in RAM is lost when the computer is powered off or restarted.


2)Non-volatile (permanent) memory: It includes hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs) where data is persistently stored even when the computer is turned off. This type of storage is used for long-term data retention.

# 4) What is SQL and what is a SQL database?
Ans:

SQL(Structural Query Language):

-SQL is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational Databases.

-It allows users to define, retrieve, update, and manage in a structured manner.

SQL Database: 

-A SQL database is a type of Database that follows the principles of the relational model.

-It organizes data info tables with predefined schemas and enforces data integrity through relationships and constraints.

-Common SQL Databases include MYSQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
